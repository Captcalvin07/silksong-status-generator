# silksong-status-generator
How to use:
Open Setup and put your discord AuthToken in the first box (I won't steal it you can read the code)
Either put your chosen message in the Status message box, or leave it blank and select a python file with a function titled "generate_status()" with no arguments
Either put your chosen Emoji Id in the Emoji Id message box, or leave it blank and select a python file with a function titled "generate_emoji()" with no arguments

You can get your AuthToken by opening discord on browser, pressing ctrl + shift + i and switching to network tab the reload the tab
Put "/api" into the filter, click on a random one and scroll down to a box that says "authorization", that is your AuthToken
DONT GIVE IT TO ANYBODY

You can get an Emoji Id by typing a "\" before your emoji in discord.

To use the files you ***MUST*** leave the other box blank
Click submit and run DiscordSetter.py
If you want it to continously run... Figure it out yourself for now idk lmao
